In\n      current tooling, there are usually problems with the workflow, as 3D\n      images are annotated in a 2D environment and automatic segmentation often\n      produces errors which are time consuming to correct in 2D. With\n      Chassifai’s 3D Toolkit, the time it takes to correct a machine generated\n      segmentation is greatly reduced and the frustrating task of removing the\n      same error on many slices is removed, thus increasing usability and making\n      the training of a machine learning model much faster. For removing obvious\n      machine learning errors, benchmarking showed that Classifai’s 3D Toolkit\n      can reduce the time it takes with existing tools by up to 98.5%. Saving\n      this time can both, make studies on bigger datasets possible and, in a\n      clinical environment, accelerate operation planning, for example for tumor\n      resection operations.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      For a demo of Classifai’s 3D Toolkit, check out the video below or{\" \"}\n      <a href=\"/#/projects/classifai3D\">try it out yourself</a>.\n    </p>\n    <div>\n      <YouTube id=\"2O-99Zb-JR0\" />\n    </div>\n    <p>For access to the full thesis, contact me.</p>\n  </div>\n);\n\nexport default bachelorThesisBlog;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport YouTube from \"react-youtube-embed\";\n\nimport Heading from \"../../components/shared/heading\";\n\nexport const classifaiQuickSummary =\n  \"World first usable active learning system for medical image segmentation.

Over a span of 10\n      months, we developed a fully working prototype of the software called\n      Classifai.

For the whole process, little machine learning\n      expertise is required, which enables medical experts to train machine\n      learning models without the help from data scientists.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Classifai runs in the web browser and offloads all the heavy computing\n      such as machine learning to a server.
