In\n      current tooling, there are usually problems with the workflow, as 3D\n      images are annotated in a 2D environment and automatic segmentation often\n      produces errors which are time consuming to correct in 2D. With\n      Chassifai’s 3D Toolkit, the time it takes to correct a machine generated\n      segmentation is greatly reduced and the frustrating task of removing the\n      same error on many slices is removed, thus increasing usability and making\n      the training of a machine learning model much faster. For removing obvious\n      machine learning errors, benchmarking showed that Classifai’s 3D Toolkit\n      can reduce the time it takes with existing tools by up to 98.5%. Saving\n      this time can both, make studies on bigger datasets possible and, in a\n      clinical environment, accelerate operation planning, for example for tumor\n      resection operations.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      For a demo of Classifai’s 3D Toolkit, check out the video below or{\" \"}\n      <a href=\"/#/projects/classifai3D\">try it out yourself</a>.\n    </p>\n    <div>\n      <YouTube id=\"2O-99Zb-JR0\" />\n    </div>\n    <p>For access to the full thesis, contact me.</p>\n  </div>\n);\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport YouTube from \"react-youtube-embed\";\n\nimport { CenteredHeading } from \"../../components/shared/heading\";\n\nexport const classifaiQuickSummary =\n  \"World first usable active learning system for medical image segmentation.

It supports creating new machine learning models based on a\n      default model architecture for custom use cases, and also the use of\n      pretrained models. For the whole process, little machine learning\n      expertise is required, which enables medical experts to train machine\n      learning models without the help from data scientists.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Classifai runs in the web browser and offloads all the heavy computing\n      such as machine learning to a server. This way users don’t need very\n      powerful devices themselves and cross platform support is achieved as any\n      operating system with any browser can run the system.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The web frontend is built with React and uses the library Three.js to\n      leverage WebGL for the graphics. It communicates to the backend via a\n      REST-API. The backend is programmed with Python to give easy access to\n      machine learning and uses the Django framework for the database.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      My main role in the team was programming the editor itself.

While machine learning\n      approaches promise to fully automate it, they most often still depend on\n      manually labeled training data. We thus present a GPU-based volumetric\n      region growing approach for semi-automatic brain tumor segmentation that\n      can be interactively tuned. Additionally, we propose multidimensional\n      transfer functions for ray tracing that allow users to judge the quality\n      of the grown region. Our implementation produces a full brain tumor\n      segmentation within a few milliseconds on consumer hardware. The\n      visualization uses adaptive resolution scaling and progressive,\n      asynchronous shading computation to maintain a stable 60 Hz refresh rate.\n    </p>\n    <SmallCenteredHeading text=\"Presentation\" />\n    <div>\n      <YouTube id=\"isNfZmr5XNw\" />\n    </div>\n  </div>\n);\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { ProjectSummary } from \"../../screens/project\";\n\nexport const sphereDotsSummary = (\n  <ProjectSummary>\n    This project showcases evenly distributed points on a sphere.

This means\n      that whenever the user moves the virtual camera, we reduce the resolution\n      in order to keep a high framerate. Then, when the user stops moving the\n      camera, we progressively render a higher resolution off screen and flush\n      it to the screen when the new higher resolution image is completely\n      rendered. Rendering the higher resolution images progressively prevents\n      lag spikes when the user starts moving the virtual camera during the\n      rendering process of the higher resolution images because it means that\n      the rendering process can be easily interrupted.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      VISIAN can be tried out{\" \"}\n      <a\n        href=\"https://app.visian.org\"\n        target=\"_blank\"\n        rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n      >\n        here\n      </a>\n      .
