  <p>
    I am a young and active software engineer from Berlin, Germany. After
    completing my Bachelor&apos;s degree in IT Systems Engineering at HPI I am
    now working on my Master&apos;s degree. My main interests are computer
    graphics and machine learning. However, I also like to dabble with human
    computer interaction and UI design and have quite some experience with web
    development. Next to my Master&apos;s degree I am currently continuing
    development of{" "}

    Digital Health and Machine Learning at HPI in order to bring the system to
    users.
