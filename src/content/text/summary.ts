Me in a Nutshell`;

export const summaryText = `
I am a young and active software engineer from Berlin, Germany. 
After completing my Bachelor's degree in IT Systems Engineering at HPI I am now working on my Master's degree.
My main interests are computer graphics and machine learning.
However, I also like to dabble with human computer interaction and UI design and have quite some experience with web development.
Next to my Master's degree I am currently continuing development of Classifai together with a few other students and the chair for Digital Health and Machine Learning at HPI in order to bring the system to market.`;
