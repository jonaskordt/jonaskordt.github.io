      During my studies in IT-Systems Engineering at Hasso Plattner Institute at
      the University of Potsdam, I have been part of a bachelor project team at
      the chair for Digital Health and Machine Learning. The goal of the project
      was to design and develop a usable active learning tool for 3D image
      segmentation in life science and medical applications. Over a span of 10
      months, we developed a fully working prototype of the software called
      Classifai. For a popular scientific explanation of the project you can
      check out our final project presentation{" "}

      Classifai introduces an active learning workflow and brings an entirely
      new and easy to use editor with it, which supports touch and touch pen
      interaction. It supports creating new machine learning models based on a
      default model architecture for custom use cases, and also the use of
      pretrained models. For the whole process, little machine learning
      expertise is required, which enables medical experts to train machine
      learning models without the help from data scientists.

    <p>
      Classifai runs in the web browser and offloads all the heavy computing
      such as machine learning to a server. This way users donâ€™t need very
      powerful devices themselves and cross platform support is achieved as any
      operating system with any browser can run the system.

      The web frontend is built with React and uses the library Three.js to
      leverage WebGL for the graphics. It communicates to the backend via a
      REST-API. The backend is programmed with Python to give easy access to
      machine learning and uses the Django framework for the database.

      My main role in the team was programming the editor itself. It is build
      with WebGL using Three.js. For an overview of the editor check out this
      demo video{" "}
